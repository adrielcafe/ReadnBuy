# Read n' Buy
> **Read n' Buy** is an open source Android app developed at the Vanhackathon for Shopify's challenge.

[Sample app](read-n-buy.apk)

## Project
Read n' Buy is a **news app**. But instead of showing the traditional advertising banners he is integrated with Shopify and allows the users **buy without leave the app**.

*What's the problem with ads?* First of all, they are ugly. Second thing, they are annoying. When you click on an ad banner this is what happens:
- You leave the app and go to the browser
- Add the product to the cart
- Login (if needed)
- And then you do checkout
- You still have to back to the app

**This ruins the user experience and drastically decreases the conversion rate.**

On my project I've tried to fix this. There are two objectives: 1) **increase the conversion rate** and 2) **simplify the buy flux**. 

To do it, first we need to **bring the shop to the app**. With the Shopify SDK I'm able to:
- Allow users do login/logout with their shop credentials (so I can get their email, shipping address and so on)
- Get the product descriptions
- Buy products (add them to the cart and do checkout without leave the app)

I'm using the [Native Checkout](https://help.shopify.com/api/sdks/mobile-buy-sdk/android/integration-guide/checkout#using-native-checkout), this grants a seamless buy flux. 

On my tests I took 1~2 minutes to buy a product when I clicked on an ad banner. With my approach I took less than 30 seconds!


## Why?

> **The growth of mobile will force brands to optimize mobile checkout:** With mobile commerce expected to grow at a rate 300% faster than traditional e-Commerce, according to discount and deals site Coupofy, more brands are likely to focus on implementing a seamless checkout experience in the coming year.

> **New mobile marketing channels:** Today, Facebook has a ‘Shop Now’ call-to-action, Instagram also has a ‘Shop Now’ button under posts, and Pinterest has “Buyable Pins”, improving the buying journey immensely on mobile devices.

> **Mobile Ad Spend still lags behind Mobile Media Consumption:** Despite the growth in media time above, some advertisers are missing out since the right-most bar shows that there is a huge missing opportunity on mobile advertising.

## Final Thoughts
I believe that the future of commerce will be a seamless and convenient mobile experience, when costumers will be invited to buy products in a non-intrusive way.

Some other features that will impact more and more the M-Commerce and E-Commerce are:
* Privacy control
* Gamefication
* Loyalty programs
* Instant gratification
